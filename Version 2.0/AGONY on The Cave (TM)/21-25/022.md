> NO WONDER  digital games are the emergent cultural form of our time. The times have themselves become just a series of less and less perfect games. The Cave presents games in a pure state, as a realm where justice—of a sort—reigns. The beginnings of a critical theory of games—a gamer theory—might lie not in holding games accountable as failed representations of the world, but quite the reverse. The world outside is a gamespace that appears as an imperfect form of the computer game. The gamer is an archeologist of The Cave. The computer games that the gamer finds there are the ruins not of a lost past but of an impossible future. Gamespace is built on the ruins of a future it proclaims in theory yet disavows in practice. To the extent that the gamer theorist wants to hack or “mod” the game, it is to play even more intimately within it.[^1] The gamer theorist is not out to break the game. The point is not to reduce the game to the level of the imperfect world outside it. Like any archeologist, the gamer theorist treats these ruins of the future with obsessive care and attention to their preservation, not their destruction.
