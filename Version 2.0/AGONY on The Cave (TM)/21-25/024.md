>  OF ALL the kinds of belonging that contend for allegiance—as workers against the boss, as citizens against the enemy, as believers against the infidel—all now have to compete with one which makes agon its first and only principle.

A new historical persona slouches toward the ergonomic chair to be born. All of the previous such persona had many breviaries and manuals, and so this little book in your hands seeks to offer guidance for thinking within this new persona. An ABC of theory for gamers.

A primer, rather, in thinking about a world made over as a gamespace, made over as an imperfect copy of the game. The game might not be utopia, but it might be the only thing left with which to play against gamespace.
