>  Jodi Dean: “I’m intrigued by the reversals—the ones that involve cave, reality, and play. It’s quite bold to begin a critique of ‘reality’/gamespace from something like a game. On the one hand, it’s traditional—like any allegory. On the other hand, folks like to think that we somehow judge the game against reality or illusions against something we think of as true. What a bizarre neo-post-retro Platonism! So, play becomes the rules within the game and regular old reality is held up against this. I think that game theorists would likely be delighted. I wonder, though, about the loss/erasure of desire. It makes sense that games/ gamespace are in the realm of drives—it’s not really about the end, it’s about getting there—but you really go back and forth between these logics. So, here, it seems that desire would reappear, despite claims to the contrary. And, then I start thinking about good old jouissance. Fragmentation seems a little too predictable, planned. But there are disruptions. Games crash. And surely the military entertainment complex crashes a lot. Crassly put—they really fuck up a lot on their own terms. And, what about the ways that the users reconfigure the systems, the games, the technology, going against what’s set for them. I’m not convinced that this is usefully re-appropriated into yet another level of game play.”
