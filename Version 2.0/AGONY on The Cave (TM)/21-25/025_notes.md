> Hugh: “I think the single player/multi-player distinction which comes up here is really important. Playing a single player game, I know that what happens doesn’t matter, in the sense that it is between me and a computer which I can restart if I don’t like how that game’s going. Life is a lot more like a multi-player game, but once one acknowledges this, I feel like maybe anthropology sneaks into gamer theory, and games become one social context among others.” Christian McCrea: “I agree that single player games are where the bulk of analytical potential still lies, especially since World of Warcraft dominates the online gaming sphere, and with it anthropology dominates its analysis.”
