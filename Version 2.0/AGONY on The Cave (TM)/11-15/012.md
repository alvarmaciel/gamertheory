However in games like World of Warcraft, which value cooperation within guilds or tribes, it seems that gamers are willing to play the role of contributing group member (citizen)�. I'm not suggesting that one can be a real-world citizen within a game, but that game play can also function in the realm of desire � i.e. that gameplay in some ways, in some cases seems to function as a substitute for what is lacking in the real-world �in this case, the yearning to be a contributing member of a group, i.e. a citizen."

>The old identities fade away. Nobody has the time. The gamer is not interested in playing the citizen.[^1] The law is fine as a spectator sport on Court TV, but being a citizen just involves you in endless attempts to get out of jury duty. Got a problem? Tell it to Judge Judy. The gamer elects to choose sides only for the purpose of the game. This week it might be as the Germans vs. the Americans. Next week it might be as a gangster against the law. If the gamer chooses to be a soldier and play with real weapons, it is as an Army of One, testing and refining personal skill points. The shrill and constant patriotic noise you hear through the speakers masks the slow erosion of any coherent fellow feeling within the remnants of national borders. This gamespace escapes all checkpoints. It is an America without qualities, for everyone and nobody. All that is left of the nation is an everywhere that is nowhere, an atopia of noisy, righteous victories and quiet, sinister failures. Manifest destiny — the right to rule through virtue — gives way to its latent destiny — the virtue of right through rule. Civic virtue drowns in a hurricane of mere survivalism.
