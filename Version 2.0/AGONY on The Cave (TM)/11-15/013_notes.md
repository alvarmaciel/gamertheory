>Roger Caillois, Man, Games and Play, (Urbana IL: University of Illinois Press, 2001), p. 114. This text is a standard in game studies, new and old, but rarely is Caillois put back into the political context of his time. In his Discourse on Colonialism, (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1972), pp. 73, Aimé Césaire indicts Caillois as a "thinker who, while claiming to be dedicated to rigorous logic, sacrifices so willingly to prejudice and wallows voluptuously in clichés." Caillois' version of ethnography is for Césaire premised on the superiority of the west, and while it is a quite different text that Césaire is attacking here, his indictment may also apply to Man, Play and Games, which makes a case for the superiority of a certain order of games which is distinctly European.
