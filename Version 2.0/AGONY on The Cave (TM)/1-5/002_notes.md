Steve: "ahh.. but I remember the 'cave' when arcades first came out. In my case it was called Dark Star. It sucked up a lot of token/quarters. it was totally isolated inside but for the sounds of video games, and black lights with dim tungsten lighting. As I remember it took me entirely out of the external world. it was always a shock to exit dark star and "reenter" the real world."
