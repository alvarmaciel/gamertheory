>Perhaps you are not just any gamer. Perhaps you want to break with the stereotype [^1]. You are the one who decides to investigate the assumption of a real world beyond the game. You turn away from the screen and unplug the headphones. You get up and stagger out of the darkened room, toward the light outside. You are so dazzled by the light that the people and things out there in the bright world seem less real than the images and sounds of The Cave. You turn away from this blinding new world, which seems, strangely, unreal. You return to the screen and the headphones and the darkness of being a gamer in The Cave.

### Footnotes

[^1]:  Sal: "I'm not sure about this assumption that gamers generally don't look at/participate in the 'real world'. It seems to perpetuate the stereotype of the adolescent boy gamer, isolated from the real world, living out a fantasy etc, when actually most gamers are older and don't fit this kind of stereotype at all. I know you are drawing on Plato and trying to pull out a particular point, but I can't help but feel tired of having the stereotype hauled out and given another airing - whatever the point you're trying to make."
