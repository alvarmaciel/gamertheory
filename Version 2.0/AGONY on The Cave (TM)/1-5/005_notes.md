"Plato, The Republic, translated by Desmond Lee (London: Penguin, 2003), p. 243, [516d]. Actually the translation used here is by Ted Sadler, and is quoted in Martin Heidegger, The Essence of Truth, (London: Continuum, 2002), p. 31. In Homo Ludens, (Boston: Beacon Press, 1950), Johan Huizinga perhaps first makes this move, of seeing reflective thought and competitive play as not being at odds, but rather the former being a consequence of the latter. See also Mihai Spariosu, God of Many Names: Play, Poetry and Power in Hellenic Thought from Homer to Aristotle, (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1991). However, my interest is less in the slippery category of play than in the more formally definable properties of the game. As Gregory Bateson says: "The difference between a game and just playing is that a game has rules." Steps to an Ecology of Mind, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000)."
