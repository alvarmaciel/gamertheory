Sal: "I'm not sure about this assumption that gamers generally don't look at/participate in the 'real world'. It seems to perpetuate the stereotype of the adolescent boy gamer, isolated from the real world, living out a fantasy etc, when actually most gamers are older and don't fit this kind of stereotype at all. I know you are drawing on Plato and trying to pull out a particular point, but I can't help but feel tired of having the stereotype hauled out and given another airing - whatever the point you're trying to make."
