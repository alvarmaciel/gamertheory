>Suppose there is a business in your neighborhood called The CaveTM. It offers, for an hourly fee, access to game consoles in a darkened room. Suppose it is part of a chain. The consoles form a local area network, and also link to other such networks elsewhere in the chain. Suppose you are a gamer in The Cave. You test your skills against other gamers. You have played in The Cave since childhood [^1]. Your eyes see only the monitor before you. Your ears hear only through the headphones that encase them. Your hands clutch only the controller with which you blast away at the digital figures who shoot back at you on the screen. Here gamers see the images and hear the sounds and say to each other: “Why, these images are just shadows! These sounds are just echoes! The real world is out there somewhere.” The existence of another, more real world of which The Cave provides mere copies is assumed, but nobody thinks much of it. Here reigns the wisdom of Playstation: Live in your world, play in ours.


[^1]:  Steve: "ahh.. but I remember the 'cave' when arcades first came out. In my case it was called Dark Star. It sucked up a lot of token/quarters. it was totally isolated inside but for the sounds of video games, and black lights with dim tungsten lighting. As I remember it took me entirely out of the external world. it was always a shock to exit dark star and "reenter" the real world."
