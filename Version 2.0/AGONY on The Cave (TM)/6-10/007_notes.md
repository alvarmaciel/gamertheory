>Paula Berinstein: "Sorry to be so picky, but 'opiate' isn't a verb."

>Kathy Fitch: "I'm not usually a fan of rampant verbing of nouns, either, but there's something kind of fetching about 'opiate' as a verb in this context, because it made me think of Opie of Mayberry, USA--one of the epicenters of imaginary solutions to real problems. [On the Andy Griffith Show, where Ron Howard played Opie.] So, the poet trumps the grammarian, this time."
