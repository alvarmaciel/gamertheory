>Twel: "One question about narrative structure: when the gamer emerges from the cave, the 'real' world appears confusing and unrecognizable so s/he returns to the game. once s/he returns to the 'real' world and is forced to look around, it appears like a game. My question is essentially a 'which came first?' first, did the game precede the real world, structuring the gamer's perception of it? second, if the 'real' world is as spectral as The Cave(tm), wouldn't the two be equivalent, see Adorno, Debord, Baudrillard; and if so, wouldn't the gamer more easily transition into the 'real'? Also, there is one tension I feel about using the Plato. I think it is really astute comparison, especially with caves being so prominent in the history of gaming. However, for Plato the outside world is the world of the Forms, itself inaccessible by everyday experience. So if we retain the Platonic, as the gamer emerges from The Cave into the 'real' world we are still at one remove from the Forms. in other words, we may be out of the electronic Cave(tm), but we are still within the Platonic cave. From this perspective, it would seem that gaming has prepared the gamer to recognize the spectral existence of the 'real', or, has made him the philosopher. The difference is that there is not, at this point, any indication that there will be another Real behind the society of spectacle."

>Jeff Lyons: "Okay. You are making a comparison with Plato's allegory of the cave. Ontologically, you are saying there is a game world and there is a 'real world.' Then you shift and say that 'These games are no joke. When the screen flashes the legend game over, you are either dead, or defeated, or at best out of quarters.' ï¿½ Are you saying that fantasy has overtaken reality, and that the ontological distinction between the fantasy world of video games and the real world (outside the cave) has been blurred?"
