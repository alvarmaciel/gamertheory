[^1]:  Twel: "One question about narrative structure: when the gamer emerges from the cave, the 'real' world appears confusing and unrecognizable so s/he returns to the game. once s/he returns to the 'real' world and is forced to look around, it appears like a game. My question is essentially a 'which came first?' first, did the game precede the real world, structuring the gamer's perception of it? second, if the 'real' world is as spectral as The Cave(tm), wouldn't the two be equivalent, see Adorno, Debord, Baudrillard; and if so, wouldn't the gamer more easily transition into the 'real'? Also, there is one tension I feel about using the Plato. I think it is really astute comparison, especially with caves being so prominent in the history of gaming. However, for Plato the outside world is the world of the Forms, itself inaccessible by everyday experience. So if we retain the Platonic, as the gamer emerges from The Cave into the 'real' world we are still at one remove from the Forms. in other words, we may be out of the electronic Cave(tm), but we are still within the Platonic cave. From this perspective, it would seem that gaming has prepared the gamer to recognize the spectral existence of the 'real', or, has made him the philosopher. The difference is that there is not, at this point, any indication that there will be another Real behind the society of spectacle."
Jeff Lyons: "Okay. You are making a comparison with Plato's allegory of the cave. Ontologically, you are saying there is a game world and there is a 'real world.' Then you shift and say that 'These games are no joke. When the screen flashes the legend game over, you are either dead, or defeated, or at best out of quarters.' � Are you saying that fantasy has overtaken reality, and that the ontological distinction between the fantasy world of video games and the real world (outside the cave) has been blurred?"

>Here is what you observe about the world outside The Cave: The whole of life appears as a vast accumulation of commodities and spectacles, of things wrapped in images and images sold as things.[^1] But how are these images and things organized, and what role do they call for anyone and everyone to adopt towards them? Images appeal as prizes, and call us to play the game in which they are all that is at stake. You observe that world after world, cave after cave, what prevails is the same agon, the same digital logic of one versus the other, ending in victory or defeat. Agony rules! Everything has value only when ranked against another; everyone has value only when ranked against another. Every situation is win-lose, unless it is win-win — a situation where players are free to collaborate only because they seek prizes in different games. The real world appears as a video arcadia divided into many and varied games. Work is a rat race. Politics is a horse race. The economy is a casino. Even the utopian justice to come in the afterlife is foreclosed: He who dies with the most toys wins. Games are no longer a pastime, outside or alongside of life. They are now the very form of life, and death, and time, itself. These games are no joke. When the screen flashes the legend game over, you are either dead, or defeated, or at best out of quarters.
